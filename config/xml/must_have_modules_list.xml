Create different sales offers, display packs in cross selling areas, select product combinations available for pack sales, simplify stock and VAT management…]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[A PRECIOUS TOOL FOR ADDITIONAL SALES Advanced Pack enables you&nbsp;to increase your average cart value&nbsp;by offering your customers the opportunity to purchase a coherent set of products, called a pack, at an attractive price. By grouping together products whose simultaneous sale makes sense (such as a camera, its tripod and the appropriate memory card),&nbsp;you guide your customers&nbsp;through their buying process, just as you would in a physical store, while&nbsp;saving them time.&nbsp;Indeed, by showcasing complementary products on the same page, you save them the hassle of searching for each product individually, with the risk of, for instance, not selecting compatible products. With the pack, they can add multiple items to their cart&nbsp;with a single click,&nbsp;ensuring they purchase the correct references. Thanks to your packs, you also enable your customers&nbsp;to save money&nbsp;by offering these product sets at a discounted price. For instance, Advanced Pack allows you to provide one of the products in the pack for free or to offer customized discounts based on the item combinations selected. Finally, creating a pack allows you&nbsp;to improve the visibility of certain products&nbsp;by associating them with your best-sellers. A FAST AND INTUITIVE PACK CREATION Inherit product information Select the products to be included in the pack, save: the pack can already be sold on your site with a set of default parameters. Nothing could be faster! All the properties of the products making up the pack are&nbsp;automatically retrieved&nbsp;(descriptions, prices, images, features, etc.) to save you time: no need to rewrite descriptions, reinsert images, etc...&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;automatically displays the images and descriptions of the products in the pack in tabs on the product page. You can then customize this display if you want! Your customers can therefore be properly informed about all the products in the pack&nbsp;while remaining on the same page,&nbsp;and&nbsp;finalize their purchase with a single click. Fine management of combinations Unlike PrestaShop's native "pack" functionality,&nbsp;you don't need to create a pack for each product combination:&nbsp;the module's creation tool allows you, for each product to be included in the pack, to choose the combination(s) you want to make available specifically for this mode of sale. For example, you can make only certain colors of a product available if it is purchased within a pack. You can also define a default combination for each product, even if it is different from the one defined in your catalog,&nbsp;in order to sell off certain stocks more easily. Once your pack is built, your customers are free to select, for each item in the pack, the attribute (color, size, dimension, ...) they want from those you have chosen to make available. They benefit from the same preferential discount defined for the pack, regardless of the chosen combination, even if the combinations have different prices (price impacts on combinations are taken into account). Pack Customization In addition to choosing the combinations to be included in the pack, you can let your customers change the quantity of each of the products included in the pack, or set them yourself. Advanced Pack also gives you the option of letting your customers remove a product from the pack, if they want. Would you like a product to be sold only through a pack? That's also possible! You can even make it a free gift. For example, you can offer an extended warranty for the purchase of a dishwasher. This extension will then be exclusively conditioned to the purchase of the dishwasher. With Advanced Pack, the customization possibilities are endless! (*)See conditions in "Features" section ENCOURAGE YOUR CUSTOMERS TO ORDER IN PACKS WITH A SPECIAL OFFER To encourage your customers to order a product as part of a pack rather than on its own, offer them a benefit they can't refuse! Advanced Pack allows you to create three types of sales offers. 3 types of sales offers are possible thanks to Advanced Pack: Offer a specific discount on each product in the packApply a general discount on all productsApply a fixed price to the pack, like a psychological price, for example In addition to these possibilities,&nbsp;Advanced Pack&nbsp;allows you to take into account, or not, the discounts that may already exist on your products. You thus have the choice between: reflecting existing discounts on the sale price of the packor, on the contrary, exclude them to favor the discount defined for the pack The module also includes&nbsp;a dynamic pack price simulator&nbsp;to help you create your sales operation. On the customer side, and unlike the native "pack" functionality, the sales offer related to the pack purchase is clearly highlighted on the product page. The visitor immediately understands that he can save money by favoring this method. QUICK AND EASY ORDER AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT Ordering a pack is managed in such a way that&nbsp;you retain the advantages of ordering separate products.&nbsp;First of all, the pack stock is calculated from the stocks of its products. There's no need to define stock at pack level. Each time a pack is ordered, individual product stocks are&nbsp;automatically deducted.&nbsp;Then, on the invoice and order details in the back-office, each product appears on a different line, as if it had been ordered separately. This has major advantages: No surprises when it comes to stocks: for each product,&nbsp;you have just one stock to manage,&nbsp;whether the product is sold on its own or as part of a pack. You avoid the complexities of managing two different stocks for the same product.Refunds and returns are managed&nbsp;at the individual product level:&nbsp;for example, you can refund only one product in a pack, or put a returned product back on sale.Easy management of products&nbsp;with different VAT rates:&nbsp;the invoice displays the tax amount for each different VAT rate.Ability to export pack orders&nbsp;to an ERP-type management and analysis system, without having to make any technical modifications to enable it to take pack orders into account. Moreover, if one of the products (or a product combination) in a pack is out of stock, the pack will&nbsp;automatically be indicated as unavailable for purchase&nbsp;using an availability alert system.&nbsp;No risk of you receiving orders for unavailable products!&nbsp;An option also allows you to force the display of another combination if the default combination is out of stock. INCREASE PACK VISIBILITY WITH CROSS-SELLING For even greater visibility, you can display a block "This product is also available in pack" on the pages of products that are also part of a pack. In this way, thanks to a dedicated commercial offer, you can encourage your customers to order the pack rather than the product alone. In short, this is&nbsp;cross-selling:&nbsp;an accessible and effective way of&nbsp;increasing your average cart! POSSIBILITY TO SELL A SAME PRODUCT IN BUNDLES (minimum compatibility PrestaShop 1.7.7.0) Do you have products that can be packaged in bundles of several units? Offer your customers the chance to save money by ordering a product in a bundle rather than individually, thanks to a dedicated offer. They'll be able to order the bundle directly from the page of the concerned product.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.18]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.4.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.8.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[279.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[317.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[243.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-create-product-packs-and-bundles.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-create-product-packs-and-bundles.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1768]]></id><name><![CDATA[gmerchantcenter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Merchant Center (Google-Shopping)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Price Comparison]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,&hellip;) and Google partner sites!]]></description><author><![CDATA[Business Tech]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/price-comparison/1768-google-merchant-center-google-shopping.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/1768.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Export your products on Google Merchant Center to display them on Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image, the Display network (YouTube, Gmail,&hellip;) and Google partner sites!]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Showcase your products on&nbsp;all the channels of Google Ads Shopping campaigns&nbsp;and develop your visibility without further delay.

Shop Product Reviews allows you to collect your customers' opinions&nbsp;about your products&nbsp;but also&nbsp;about their general shopping experience on your shop.&nbsp;Do you want to know their opinion on specific points? Define&nbsp;your own rating criteria,&nbsp;either for your products or your shop. You want to import your old reviews to keep your history? No problem, the module offers a simple and intuitive import/export tool!&nbsp;And if you currently have the native module of PrestaShop (Product Comments) or the module of store and product reviews from Línea Gráfica, the import is&nbsp;totally automatic,&nbsp;you do not have to do anything,&nbsp;you just have to install our module and it takes care of retrieving the history of your reviews!&nbsp;Our module&nbsp;respects the GDPR&nbsp;and&nbsp;all the European directives in force&nbsp;(such as the decree n° 2017-1436, or the directive (EU) 2019/2161) concerning the information obligations related to online consumer reviews, by putting in place everything necessary for the customer to be informed in a clear and precise way about the review management system. It allows you to display a "Verified Purchase" badge to certify that the review is a result of an order, and only customers who have an account can review your products and your shop.&nbsp;INCREASE YOUR CONVERSION RATE AND YOUR REVENUE&nbsp;88% of Internet users&nbsp;consult customer reviews before making a purchase on an e-commerce site and&nbsp;91% of 18-25 year olds&nbsp;give as much importance to reviews on the Internet as to those of their relatives. By displaying customer reviews of your products and/or your store on your website, you&nbsp;increase your customers' trust&nbsp;in your brand. Customer reviews are a social proof of your store's reliability and play the role of a digital word of mouth. The importance of customer reviews in the e-commerce world is well known: they are now&nbsp;a key element in the decision-making process and in your marketing strategy.&nbsp;Moreover, customer reviews are a great free advertising tool and a way to get relevant, recent and regularly renewed content. This UGC (User Generated Content) is one of the main criteria examined by Google to improve your SEO. If your theme is properly tagged, Google will be able to show the stars corresponding to the average rating of the products in its natural results which will also improve&nbsp;your visibility, your click rate and your traffic.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;"Shop Product Reviews"&nbsp;module is much more than a simple review collection module. With its multiple features and options for displaying reviews, whether on product pages or list pages, through dedicated blocks or badges, our&nbsp;"Shop Product Reviews"&nbsp;module allows you&nbsp;to reassure your customers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase your conversion rate.&nbsp;According to a study, from the first review posted on a product, the conversion rate increases by 10%, then 30% after 50 reviews, and up to more than 44% with 200 reviews! So don't hesitate!&nbsp;COLLECT REVIEWS ON YOUR PRODUCTS, YOUR SHOP OR BOTH!&nbsp;The ""Shop Product Reviews"" module&nbsp;allows you to activate&nbsp;independently&nbsp;the collection of product reviews and the collection of reviews on your store in general. For each review system, many options are available: activation of moderation, display of reviews only in the current language, activation of a voting system, display of a "latest reviews" block, etc...&nbsp;The product ratings will be displayed as stars. You have the ability to customize the color of the stars to fit your theme as there are an infinite number of colors available.&nbsp;A "Verified Purchase" badge&nbsp;can be displayed next to the reviews that result from an order, to&nbsp;further reinforce the confidence of future buyers.&nbsp;The color of the badge is also fully customizable as well as its text.&nbsp;Whether it is for product or shop reviews,&nbsp;a system of precise scheduling of the sending of rating request e-mails is available.&nbsp;You also have the possibility to send a reminder if your customer has not given a review following the first e-mail. The titles and texts of the e-mails&nbsp;can be configured&nbsp;directly through the module, for each language of your store.&nbsp;Product reviews&nbsp;Give the possibility to evaluate a product to all registered customers or only to customers who ordered the product. The latter option makes it possible to further increase the reliability of customer feedback on your products.&nbsp;Enjoy flexible positioning on product pages: Display your reviews either in the footer or within a tab (if your theme supports page tabs), and decide where to position the average product rating. Also decide to display the average product rating on list pages.&nbsp;Allow your visitors to filter the reviews by rating and sort them as they want. Show them the distribution of the number of reviews by rating and allow them to get a quick and global idea of the reviews on a product, by enabling the display of a "battle" block showing the best review and the most critical one opposite each other.&nbsp;Also note that by implementing product reviews, the average rating can appear in Google's natural results as stars,&nbsp;which will attract attention and increase your visibility.&nbsp;Links that display a product rating have&nbsp;a click-through rate (CTR) between 15 and 30% higher.&nbsp;Shop reviews&nbsp;Why not also collect feedback from your customers about their overall shopping experience?&nbsp;Activate shop reviews&nbsp;and allow your customers to share their feelings about their experience on your site, the choice offered, the offers or even the ease of payment and delivery! This will strengthen the bond you have with them by showing them that you are listening to their needs and will contribute to&nbsp;increase loyalty.&nbsp;Place the link to the shop review form wherever you want on your website: customer account, product pages, menu, ... The module also allows you to display a "shop review" badge with the average rating given by your customers to your store, on the pages of your site while choosing its position and color.&nbsp;CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM CRITERIA&nbsp;Do you want to know what your customers think about particular points? Create your own rating criteria!&nbsp;Whether it is for products or the store,&nbsp;the module offers you the possibility to create personalized criteria. You decide how the criteria are worded and whether you want to reserve them for certain products or categories!&nbsp;Use the product rating criteria to ask your customers to rate specific characteristics of certain items in order to validate or not your choice of products or suppliers: fabric quality, price, fit of a garment, sturdiness etc... It is&nbsp;a free&nbsp;way to know the efficiency of your catalog and&nbsp;a precious help&nbsp;to make informed decisions about your products.&nbsp;As for the rating criteria for your shop in general, you also have the choice: navigation, site ergonomics, variety of products, clarity of descriptions, ease of payment, or even choice of delivery points! The feedback from your customers will allow you&nbsp;to make the right choices and get a better customer satisfaction rate.&nbsp;Not to mention the SEO benefit of the criteria!&nbsp;If you guide customers by asking them to give feedback on specific topics through the rating criteria, your customers will tend to use specific keywords that will boost your SEO on certain queries.&nbsp;ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO POST A REVIEW BY OFFERING THEM A VOUCHER&nbsp;Your customers sometimes need a little help! Encourage them to leave their opinion on the products they bought, or about your shop, by offering them a voucher in exchange! This will encourage them&nbsp;to come back to place an order on your online store and will increase their loyalty.&nbsp;Once your offer is configured within the module, it will be displayed in the rating invitation e-mails and also in the product or shop rating forms.&nbsp;RIGHT TO REPLY TO BAD REVIEWS&nbsp;It's never easy to receive negative reviews. However, it can be an excellent opportunity to show that you are listening to your customers.

The “Free Delivery Manager” module offers control of delivery costs by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to order more.  Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs. The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied.

Customers can click on the "PREORDER NOW" button and follow the standard Prestashop procedure to pre-order the products. Payment Type For Pre-order Products Requesting full payment in advance for a pre-order product may not be a very good idea because many customers don’t feel comfortable doing this. With our Prestashop Pre-order extension, you can set a partial or dynamic(custom) amount that a customer can pay and reserve the product in advance. Partial payment - Set a pre-defined amount that a customer needs to pay upfront to pre-order the product.&nbsp; Dynamic Payment - Set the minimum custom amount that customers need to pay to pre-order the product. Offering customers to reserve the product by paying a fraction of the product amount encourages them to make the purchase.

Limit Pre-orders by Customer Groups and Countries Prestashop Pre-order extension allows you to configure customer groups and countries for which you want to allow pre-orders.

It puts all the checkout fields on a single page, hence providing a quick and hassle-free checkout experience to your customers. Reduces Cart AbandonmentEliminate clunky elements from your checkout and minimize the possibilities of cart abandonment. Prestashop One Page Checkout lets you customize your checkout fields as per your requirements to make them clean and appealing. A complicated checkout is one of the foremost reasons for cart abandonment, as per Baymard Institute. Increases Conversion RatePrestaShop One Step Checkout enhances the user experience and boosts your conversions. The flawless and user-friendly One Page Checkout ensures that shoppers do not find a troublesome experience on the checkout page and can make a purchase comfortably. Increases Average Order ValueThe latest update of the One Page Checkout module helps merchants to increase the average order value. Wondering how? Well, you can now place a free shipping banner on the checkout page which displays how much more does a user needs to shop for, to be eligible for free shipping. It is displayed as a progress bar. Build a Community of Businesses and Individual CustomersWith the use of PrestaShop One Page Checkout on your store, you will be able to form groups and communities of business and individual(customer) profiles. This way you can promote your product and run deals separately. Marketing campaigns will become more focused after the addition of this new feature.  What’s New: Custom Profile Type field: The admin can add a drop-down menu or radio buttons for users to choose their profile type. Create profile types like:BusinessClientIndividual Show total price: Admin can show the total prices with tax, without tax or both. Custom fields: The admin can enable the option to show the custom fields in the invoice.   Validation for CIF/DNI/NIF: The store owner can now enable validation for CIF/DNI/NIF on the checkout page of his store.  Abandoned Checkout Statistics: In the configuration tabs, there is one newly added feature i.e. Abandoned checkout statistics through which the admin gets an in-depth analysis of the abandoned cart details as well as the order details. It puts in front a clear picture regarding how much revenue is lost on abandoned carts and how much revenue is generated through complete orders generated by the customers.

Increase customer trust and sales while reducing date-related support requests. Show your customers the estimated delivery date, from basic to elaborate configurations, on the product page, order process, and emails.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The importance of delivery dates cannot be overstated, particularly for customers eager to spend their money in your store. This module assists you in assisting your consumers by providing features that make the overall purchasing experience of your customers easy and efficient. When shopping online, you probably have found yourself wanting to know when a product will arrive more than once. There might be several reasons for this, such as that you need the product by a specific date or are eager to receive it... In all of these cases, knowing the estimated delivery date of the product can influence your purchasing decision by increasing your trust in that shop and making you more comfortable and secure in making the purchase. From the owner’s perspective, once configured, you will see a drop in all support inquiries relating to delivery dates (this has been verified by our clients numerous times) and an increase in the sales, making the investment completely worthwhile. Internally, the module always attempts to separate its configurations into two modes: basic and advanced, making it possible to configure the module in 5 minutes while still allowing for complex configurations for those shops that require precise setups. This is possible because the module’s features handle the preparation and delivery process as if it were real life. To help you understand how it works, we've presented some of the features you’ll find particularly helpful. Geolocation: The module uses unregistered users' geolocation to determine which carriers should be displayed for that customer. The customer's stored addresses will be used after they've logged in. Display modes and customization: Without editing a single line of code, a broad range of choices are available to simply define each parameter, such as style, time format, location, and colour of the Estimated Delivery information box.Carrier-based configurations: You can set all carrier parameters globally or individually for each carrier with the advanced options.Global settings: Date modification using global parameters such as categories, manufacturers, or suppliers Product-based configurations: When configured, they override the general settings, enabling you to change the delivery time of your items by utilizing the module's unique characteristics (picking days, out-of-stock additional days, release dates, available dates...). This can be accomplished at the product or combination level. Orders and emails:The Estimated Delivery date option can also be enabled during the order process. The date can be displayed optionally on the summary, in the carrier selection phase, and finally on the order confirmation page. When this functionality is enabled, clients and administrators may check the delivery date from the order history at any time.Following the placement of the order, the delivery date can be included in the shop emails by adding a special variable on the templates. Orders by picking (pickup dates):A visual guide for determining which orders should be prioritized to meet the projected delivery dates generated at the time of the order.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[3.8.6]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.1.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[83.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[99.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[75.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/743803-pprod/estimated-delivery-date-v3-smart-modules.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/743803-pbig/estimated-delivery-date-v3-smart-modules.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[19126]]></id><name><![CDATA[iqitmegamenu]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Horizontal and vertical mega menu (navigation dropdown)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Menu]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The most advanced responsive mega menu Prestashop module.&nbsp; By using Drag&amp;Drop builder you can easily create horizontal or/and vertical dropdown navigation, and responsive mobile menu]]></description><author><![CDATA[Community developer]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/menu/19126-horizontal-and-vertical-mega-menu-navigation-dropdown.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/19126.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The most advanced responsive mega menu Prestashop module.&nbsp; By using Drag&amp;Drop builder you can easily create horizontal or/and vertical dropdown navigation, and responsive mobile menu. &nbsp;]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[IQITMEGAMENU is highly customizable responsive menu module.&nbsp;  Vertical and horizontal menu With our module you can get both navigations inside only one package.

This&nbsp;professional&nbsp;version goes even further with&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;features such as the ability to create precise product exclusion rules, to manage&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;custom labels, or to export your promotions and product reviews(*). GO EVEN FURTHER IN OPTIMIZING THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR ADS In addition to the multiple possibilities of configuring your feed that the standard version of the module already offers, you will be able to refine the choice of products or product combinations to be exported thanks to the setting up of extremely precise and personalized exclusion rules. Thanks to the advanced assignation of custom labels, you will also have the ability to segment your product catalog and therefore organize your ads according to the seasonality of your products, their popularity, or the margin you can apply to them. This allows you to control your budget by offering the right products at the right time and optimize your return on investment. In Shopping ads, the display of stars reflecting the rating of items undoubtedly gives more attractiveness to products.  Google Merchant Center Pro allows you&nbsp;to export your customers' product reviews(*)&nbsp;and to participate in the "Product Ratings" program. The reviews are collected and compiled with reviews of the same products from other sources&nbsp;(including "Google Customer Reviews" - see next paragraph - review aggregators, ...).&nbsp;If conditions are met, the average product rating can then be displayed in your ads and free product listings in the form of one to five stars. Finally, what better to encourage people to click and buy than a discount voucher featured in your ad? Thanks to our module you can filter and&nbsp;export the promotional codes&nbsp;to attach to your ads. (*)See conditions in the "Features" section HIGHLIGHT THE QUALITY OF YOUR SERVICE WITH GOOGLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS The PRO version of the Google Merchant Center module integrates the "Google Customer Reviews" feature. "Google Customer Reviews" is&nbsp;a free service&nbsp;that lets you collect, via Google,&nbsp;your customers' reviews about their shopping experience.&nbsp;If they agree to participate, they receive an email a few days after receiving their order, asking them to rate their experience between 1 and 5 stars and to leave a comment if they wish. Once a certain number of ratings have been collected, through "Google Customer Reviews" and third-party rating partners, Google can include this seller rating in your text ads and free listings. You can also display it on your store, as part of a "Google Customer Reviews" badge. Through "Google Customer Reviews", Google can also collect&nbsp;your customers' reviews of products ordered from your online store&nbsp;and compile them with those sent through your product review feed, for example (see the "product ratings feed" feature of the module).]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[smart_shopping]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.8.5]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.4.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.1.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[251.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[287.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[216.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1496427-pprod/google-merchant-center-pro-google-shopping.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1496427-pbig/google-merchant-center-pro-google-shopping.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[21318]]></id><name><![CDATA[magicredirect]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Redirections URL (301 / Auto-fixing / Multishop / SEO)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[URL & Redirects]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Predicts and automatically fix missing pages !

Our team of experts in social networks for over 10 years, accompanies you with a complete documentation and a great responsiveness to support. EXPORT A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT FEED ON FACEBOOK The "Dynamic Ads + Pixel" module allows you to configure your data feed in an extremely simple and fast way by including only the products and information you want. The advanced exclusion rules system gives you the freedom to create an optimized feed by excluding certain products from your ads. The advanced assignment of custom labels to your products further increases the customization of your data feed and allows you to increase the segmentation possibilities of your catalog. Product feeds generated and imported in the Facebook Business Manager will allow you: to automatically populate and keep updated the Shop of your Facebook Page and Instagram business profileto run product ads on Facebook and Instagram to highly targeted audiencesto show Facebook and Instagram users location-specific data (information translated into their language, prices, availability, shipping costs etc... tailored to their location) through country feedsto tag your products in your Facebook and Instagram publications or stories TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY Thanks to countless personal information collected on its network, each more accurate than the others, Facebook has a powerful advertising targeting tool on which Google can not compete. On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users. By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to further enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...). It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of dynamic retargeting. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking). For an even more accurate analysis of the effectiveness of your ads and an even better tracking of the buying journey, activate the conversions API in addition to the Pixel to send the data directly from your store's server! The power of Facebook also allows you to acquire new customers by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele. OFFER A LOCALIZED VERSION OF YOUR ADS AND YOUR FACEBOOK SHOP Our module allows you to use Facebook's country feeds to offer multi-country and multi-lingual Facebook and Instagram users a Shop and ads adapted to their location. For example, a Facebook user in the US will see your product data in English and prices in dollars in your Facebook Store, while a French user will see the same information in French and Euros. But it doesn't stop at language and currency! All data that has different values in other countries will automatically adapt to the locality (availability, sizes, shipping costs, etc...). By default, the module proposes all possible "Country/Language/Currency" combinations according to the native localization packs installed on your PrestaShop store. However, you have the possibility to create additional feeds corresponding to combinations not proposed by the module.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[social_networks]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.4.8]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.4.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.0.3]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[97.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[114.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[84.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Conversion: Agencies&#39; choice"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/awards-convert-agency.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1412117-pprod/facebook-dynamic-ads-pixel-conversions-api.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1412117-pbig/facebook-dynamic-ads-pixel-conversions-api.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[23806]]></id><name><![CDATA[cdc_googletagmanager]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Tag Manager Enhanced Ecommerce (GA4 + UA) - PRO]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Analytics & Statistics]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The most advanced and reliable module to work with Google Tag Manager!Add an enhanced and customized datalayer on every page of your shop and plug every others services you like in few clicks (Analyti]]></description><author><![CDATA[Comptoir du Code]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/analytics-statistics/23806-google-tag-manager-enhanced-ecommerce-ga4-ua-pro.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/23806.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The most advanced and reliable module to work with Google Tag Manager!Add an enhanced and customized datalayer on every page of your shop and plug every others services you like in few clicks (Analytics, Fb Pixel, Adwords...).Compatible with GA4 !]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce (GA4 & UA) :This module sends a lot more information than classic Google Analytics (or Universal Analytics), so you can have more accurate ecommerce reports.Know more about your e-commerce : Shopping and purchasing behavior, Economic performance, Merchandising success, Product Attribution... Why use Google Tag manager ?A Tag Management System (TMS) replaces hard-coded tags that are used for marketing, analytics, and testing on a website, with dynamic tags that are easier to implement and update.

This feature will allow you to tag your catalogue products in your Instagram posts and StoriesFacebook Shop Tab: Link your catalogue with your Facebook page to display all your products in the Shop tab.Dynamic Ads: If you have a module to track the Facebook events (we do recommend our module Pixel Plus) you can link a pixel with the catalogue to be able to create the Dynamic Ads, the most powerful feature from Facebook & Instagram Ads.  What are the dynamic Product Ads?It's an advanced remarketing / retargeting feature from Facebook. Automatically created ads based on the behaviour and interests of your customer. Each customer sees a customized ad for him Since the Ads are generated dynamically for each customer the campaigns have much less maintenance and a much lower cost and better conversion rates. Once the customer buys the product the modules sends the necessary data to make that customer don't see the ad any more (unless he shows interest on any of your products again).  Ease to use and well documentedEvery section of the module is well documented, meaning that you won't need any previous experience to configure and use the module. There are also some advanced options to have a better control with the feeds generation.  And a complete step-by-step guide on how to configure the module, how to create the Product Catalogues and how to configure a Cron Job (a sever side script to automatically update the feed). ErrorsThe module will also try to check and notify of the errors that Facebook may found when uploading the module making it easier to find and solve. Catalogue Filtering, the Product SetsSometimes you don’t want to show all your products in the ads, Facebook has powerful filters to create Product Sets that can later be used for Ads, this way you can exclude all the products you want from your catalogue. The number of product sets you can create on Facebook is unlimited and they won’t be lost after each automatic update.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[advertising_marketing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[2.3.9]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.9]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.1.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[79.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1288124-pprod/products-feed-catalogue-shop-for-facebook-insta.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1288124-pbig/products-feed-catalogue-shop-for-facebook-insta.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[24894]]></id><name><![CDATA[autogoogleplace]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Address Autocomplete]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Registration & Ordering Process]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[This module makes it possible to fill, quickly and without any errors, the address field when yours clients are ordering]]></description><author><![CDATA[Malttt]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/registration-ordering-process/24894-google-address-autocomplete.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/24894.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[This module makes it possible to fill, quickly and without any errors, the address field when yours clients are ordering.

Dropshipping is an eCommerce business model that allows you to sell products from your store without investing capital in inventory. The PrestaShop Aliexpress Dropshipping module basically offers merchants the to import products and their combinations from AliExpress into his/her PrestaShop store. After that, they can start selling those products to the customers of the store. As there is no obligation to hold inventory so there is no limit to the number of products they can import from AliExpress. Once the merchant receives an order on the PrestaShop, the automatic ordering process helps them to place the order on Aliexpress with a single click. In order to import the product from AliExpress to PrestaShop, a chrome extension is needed. Follow the link to download the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prestashop-aliexpress-imp/iochebggflimfedlldfjjomnkpoikknk?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog Update Products As you have imported products from AliExpress, it might happen that some product details get updated on AliExpress afterwards. This may arise issues as your customers would treat it as a discrepancy. And, if there is a difference in price then your customer might decide to not buy from your store. So, use the automatic cron settings of the module to automatically update price and quantity on your PrestaShop store too at a set interval.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.4.3]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.7.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[8.1.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[69.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[79.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[62.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1598408-pprod/aliexpress-dropshipping-product-importer.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/1598408-pbig/aliexpress-dropshipping-product-importer.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[32161]]></id><name><![CDATA[psagechecker]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Age Verification Popup]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Security & Access]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Take legal precautions when selling alcohol, tobacco or other products; check your visitors&rsquo; age with a popup window as soon as they reach your store]]></description><author><![CDATA[PrestaShop]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/website-security-access/32161-age-verification-popup.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/32161.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Take legal precautions when selling alcohol, tobacco or other products; check your visitors&rsquo; age with a popup window as soon as they reach your store. &nbsp; Retailers of certain product categories are obliged to check their customers&rsquo; age before confirming an order.

If you work with an agency, they will be able to add these metrics for you very simply and we can do this for you as well.&nbsp;Complete report customization for views tailored to your needs.The Op'art Stat module emphasizes customization, allowing you to choose precisely which metrics to display on each report and their order of appearance.&nbsp;With the variety of reports available and filtering options, you have the freedom to create views that meet your exact needs.&nbsp;Whether you want a report focused on traffic, finances, or any other aspect of your e-commerce, Op'art Stat gives you the possibility to do so and you can of course create a report with the key figures you wish to consult daily.&nbsp;You can create, duplicate, and delete reports with a single click. Thus, if you want to easily follow the sales evolution of a given category, brand or product, you just need to create a report with the corresponding filters to access its data in one click.&nbsp;Ideal for teamwork.Op'art Stat facilitates teamwork by allowing each member to benefit from all the customization features.&nbsp;Each team member can create their own reports, tailored to their needs.&nbsp;The sales manager can create reports focused on sales by product and region, while the marketing manager can focus on metrics related to advertising campaigns. Likewise, the financial director may have reports dedicated to the financial aspects of the company, etc.&nbsp;Thus, each member of the team has a clear and precise view of the information that is relevant to them, thus facilitating decision-making and collaboration.&nbsp;An autonomous module independent of any external solution.Op'art Stat is a standalone module that does not need any other module to works.&nbsp;It also does not use Google Analytics or any other external services.&nbsp;You can therefore, if you wish, get rid of these additional modules and only use Op'art Stat for all your analyses.&nbsp;You simplify the management of your e-commerce by reducing the number of modules that you must use and update regularly.&nbsp;With Op'art Stat, you have a unique and powerful tool that meets all your analysis needs, allowing you to focus on what really matters: the growth of your business.&nbsp;Fast display and maintenance of your site's performance.Op’art stat is designed to offer optimal performance. With optimized queries and asynchronous loading, it quickly displays all your metrics. (The module has been tested on stores with more than 100,000 products and 50,000 orders without encountering any problems.)&nbsp;Unlike certain statistics modules which can slow down your store by recording too much information in the database, Op'art Stat has been designed to preserve the performance of your PrestaShop.&nbsp;In fact, 90% of the data used by the module is already present in your Prestashop and will never be modified.&nbsp;For the remaining 10% of data, it is monitored and automatically limited by our module. (This limit can be modified by the merchant in the module configuration).&nbsp;Immediate access to your data historyYou have access to all your data history as soon as the module is installed. Only traffic data starts accumulating from the day of installation.&nbsp;Live dataOp'art Stat offers a "Live" table which provides real-time data on your store.
